# Terms of Service — Veronika

**Effective date:** 28/1/2026

This document is a quiet contract between you (the “User”) and the operator of the bot, Eruka (the “Operator”), who maintains and runs the Discord bot known as Veronika (the “Bot”). By inviting, using, or interacting with the Bot you accept these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

### 1. Acceptance of Terms

Use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of these Terms and any policies referenced herein. The Operator may update these Terms; changes take effect when posted. Continued use after an update means you accept the new Terms.

### 2. Who may use the Bot

You must be at least the minimum age required by Discord and local law to use the Bot. You agree not to use the Bot if you are prohibited by law or by Discord’s Terms of Service.

### 3. Permitted uses and conduct

- The Bot is provided for the purposes described in its description (utilities, moderation, miscellaneous, etc.). Use it only as intended.

- You will not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the Bot.

- You will not exploit the Bot to harass, harm, cheat, or otherwise violate Discord Community Guidelines or applicable laws.

- You will not use the Bot to send spam, unsolicited messages, or malware.

### 4. User content and responsibility

- You remain responsible for anything you post, submit, or create via the Bot (“User Content”).

- The Operator does not claim ownership of User Content, but by using the Bot you grant the Operator a non-exclusive right to store, display, and process that content for the Bot’s operation.

- The Operator may remove User Content that violates these Terms or applicable law.

### 5. Bot permissions and data access

- The Bot may request permissions in your Discord server (messages, roles, etc.) to operate. Granting permissions is voluntary and under your server’s control.

- The Bot may log limited data required for its features (IDs, timestamps, settings). See the Privacy Policy for details.

### 6. Availability, updates, and changes

- The Bot is provided “as-is.” The Operator may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot or its features at any time without notice.

- The Operator will reasonably attempt to maintain availability but makes no guarantees about uptime.

### 7. No warranties; limitation of liability

- The Bot is provided without warranties of any kind, express or implied. The Operator does not guarantee the Bot’s functionality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose.

- To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Operator is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the Bot, loss of data, or loss of profits.

### 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Operator from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or your misuse of the Bot.

### 9. Termination

The Operator may suspend or terminate access to the Bot for any user who violates these Terms or Discord’s rules. You may also remove the Bot from your server at any time.

### 10. Third-party services

The Bot may rely on third-party services (APIs, hosting providers). Use of such services is subject to their terms and privacy practices. The Operator is not responsible for the availability or behavior of third parties.

### 11. Governing law and disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Operator’s country of residence unless otherwise required by local law. If any part of these Terms is unenforceable, the rest remains in force.

12. Contact & changes
