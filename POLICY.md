# Privacy Policy — Veronika

**Effective date:** 28/1/2026

This Privacy Policy explains what information the Bot collects, how it’s used, who it is shared with, and your choices. The Operator respects privacy and seeks to be contained, transparent, and minimal.

### 1. Scope & parties

This policy covers data collected by **Veronika**, operated by **eerfandz**. It does not cover Discord’s data practices; Discord’s privacy policy governs user accounts and Discord metadata.

### 2. What we collect (minimum necessary)

The Bot collects only data essential to perform its functions. Typical items may include:

- **Discord identifiers:** server ID (guild), user ID, channel ID, message ID — needed for storing preferences, state, or associating records.

- **Settings & preferences:** user or server configuration (prefix, toggles, saved choices).

- **Interaction logs:** timestamps, commands used, and minimal context to support features, debug issues, and enforce rules.

- **Optional content:** any content you explicitly submit for processing (e.g., save files, uploads). The Bot will only keep such content as necessary.

The Bot does not collect more personal data than needed. It avoids storing full messages unless required by a feature you enable.

### 3. How we use collected data

- **To operate features:** deliver responses, keep your settings, persist game state, or run moderation tools.

- **To improve the Bot:** debugging, analytics, and improving reliability (aggregated, non-identifying where possible).

- **Security & abuse prevention:** detect abuses, enforce rules, and protect services.

### 4. Sharing and third parties

- The Operator does not sell personal data.

- Data may be shared with trusted service providers (hosting, analytics, or APIs) that help operate the Bot. Those providers process data under contract and only as necessary.

- The Bot may share minimal data with Discord where required by the platform.

- The Operator may disclose data to comply with law or to protect rights.

### 5. Data storage and deletion

- Data is stored for as long as necessary to provide the feature or to meet legal obligations.

- If you remove the Bot from a server, many server-scoped records may be deleted automatically; some logs may persist for a reasonable period for diagnostics.

- You may request deletion of your personal data by contacting **erukaidev@gmail.com**. The Operator will comply within a reasonable timeframe.

### 6. Security measures

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect data (secure hosting, access controls). However, no transmission or storage is perfectly secure; absolute guarantees cannot be made.

### 7. Children’s privacy

The Bot is not intended for users below the minimum age required by Discord. The Operator does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe such data has been collected, contact **erukaidev@gmail.com** to request removal.

### 8. Your choices and rights

- **Access & correction:** You may ask what personal data the Bot holds about you and request corrections.

- **Deletion:** You may request deletion of your personal data.

- **Opt-out:** For optional analytics or data uses, you may opt out where that option is offered.

To exercise these rights, email: **erukaidev@gmail.com**. Provide identification and reasonable details to process the request.

### 9. Changes to this policy

This policy may be updated. The Effective Date above will change when the policy is revised. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.

### 10. Contact & legal note

For privacy questions or requests: **erukaidev@gmail.com**.

> **Legal note:** This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. For binding legal compliance, especially if you process personal data of residents of jurisdictions with strong privacy laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California), consult a lawyer.
